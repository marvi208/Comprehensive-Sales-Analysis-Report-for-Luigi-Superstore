## 🧪 In-Analysis

### 🔍 Observations & Explanations

1. **Shipping Behavior**
   Standard Class shipping makes up more than half of total revenue, suggesting it’s the preferred mode. Same Day contributes the least, possibly due to its use for low-ticket items or fewer orders.

2. **Customer Insights**
   A few top customers generate a significant portion of sales. Sean Miller alone contributes over \$25,000 in revenue, indicating a high-spend customer segment worth retaining.

3. **Geographical Sales**
   California and New York lead in sales volume. Urban cities like New York City, Los Angeles, and Seattle also show higher order density.

4. **Regional Performance**
   The West region is the most profitable, followed by the East. This could be due to concentrated urban centers and tech-savvy demographics.

5. **Product Demand**
   Technology is the top-performing category. Sub-categories like Phones and Chairs have the highest sales, indicating consumer preference and possibly higher margins.

### 📌 Preliminary Recommendations

* Improve operational capacity and delivery speed for Standard Class shipping.
* Launch loyalty rewards for top-performing customers.
* Focus regional campaigns in high-performing cities like NYC and LA.
* Increase inventory and marketing around Phones, Chairs, and Technology items.
